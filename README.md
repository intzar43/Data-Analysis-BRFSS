# Brief Description
This is an exploratory data analysis of the  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys. This entire data set comprised of 490,000+ observations of 330 variables. 

# Tools and Frameworks 
We used the data manipulation and visualization libraries present in R to help us get the necessary information out of this data. 
Namely we used dplyr and ggplot2 for most of the work done in our files

# Process

The data was obtained from the following website: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html
As described above, the data set contained more than 490,000 observations with 330 different variables.
The surveys were conducted through the phone and the data was collected using a stratified random sampling technique. Then that sample was weighted using
the appropriate factors to make it more representative of the general population. From the website itself, here is a description:

"The BRFSS is designed to obtain sample information on the population of interest i.e., the adult US population
residing in different states. Data weighting helps make sample data more representative of the population from
which the data were collected. BRFSS data weights incorporate the design of BRFSS survey and characteristics of the
population. BRFSS weighting methodology comprises 1) design factors or design weight, and 2) some form of demographic
adjustment of the populationâ€”by iterative proportional fitting, or raking."

From within this large data set, a few variables that were of interest to me were chosen and filtered out. 

This is an Exploratory Data project so no modeling or predictive analysis was done of the chosen variables. However, there were some valuable insights gained from the data visualization and analysis done in the accompanying files. 

# Technical Details
The presentation tools used for this project were R Studio and R Markdown. The HTML file was made using the Rmarkdown tool, hwoever it is too large for it to be visible in the Github Repo. Most of the information necessary can be extracted from the rmd file that has been attached, but the graphs and accompanying tables will not be visible unless that code has been executed. Rstudio was used as the interface where all of this analysis and code was written, and the library knitr was used to extract the code from the rmd file. 


# Presentation Notes
The HTML file of the presentation was too large to upload properly to Github, so instead I uploaded an accompanying Word Document and PDF. THe graphs and presentation would look better if uploaded with html, but the current size limits for the repository do not permit that.
